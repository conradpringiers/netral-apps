## ✨ Why Netral?

| Problem | Netral's Answer |
|---------|----------------|
| HTML/CSS is verbose and slow | A concise, intuitive syntax that compiles to rich visuals |
| PowerPoint is heavy and rigid | Live-preview presentations built from plain text |
| Document tools lack flexibility | Export to PDF, HTML, or share via URL — all from one editor |
| Switching between tools is painful | One unified syntax, three powerful modes |

Netral bridges the gap between **simplicity** and **polish**. If you can write a text file, you can build with Netral.

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Framework | React 18 + TypeScript |
| Build | Vite |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui |
| Editor | CodeMirror 6 |
| Compression | lz-string (for shareable URLs) |
| Markdown | marked |
| Sanitization | DOMPurify |

---

## 🔗 Share by Link

Netral compresses your entire document into a URL using `lz-string`. No server, no database — the content lives in the link itself. Anyone who opens it gets a full, editable copy.

---

## 📂 File Formats

| Extension | Mode | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `.netblock` | Block | Website source files |
| `.netdeck` | Deck | Presentation source files |
| `.netdoc` | Doc | Document source files |

Files are plain text — version-control friendly, human-readable, and portable.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I need a backend or database?**
A: No. Netral runs entirely in the browser. Files are saved locally, and sharing works through URL compression.

**Q: Can I use my own theme?**
A: Currently, 11 built-in themes are available. A custom theme editor is on the roadmap.

**Q: Is the syntax similar to Markdown?**
A: Yes! Netral extends Markdown with custom components like `Feature[...]`, `Stats[...]`, `Column[...]`, etc. Standard Markdown (headings, bold, italic, lists, links) works as expected.

**Q: Can I export my work?**
A: Block exports to HTML, Doc exports to PDF (via print) or `.netdoc`, and Deck runs as a fullscreen presentation. All modes support shareable URLs.

**Q: Is it free?**
A: YES! Netral apps is free and open source. I work 100% for free because I believe that decent productivity tools should be free. My primary goal is to help as many people as possible. However, if you are satisfied, you are of course welcome to make a donation..

**Q: Did AI helped ?**
A: Yes, as my abilities as a 16-year-old were limited, I used AI to help me finish the project on time (especially in v2.0), but the concept and design are 100% mine...
