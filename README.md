# Stop clicking. Start writing.
Netral Apps is a minimalist, text-driven productivity suite designed to replace heavy, click-based tools with a simple structured writing language.
Instead of navigating complex menus, you write structured content in a lightweight markdown-style syntax — and Netral transforms it into:

- 📊 Interactive presentations
- 🌐 Structured websites
- 📄 Exportable documents (PDF-ready)
- 🔁 Visual logic flows
- 🧪 Educational content generators

## ✨ Philosophy
Modern productivity tools are powerful — but overloaded.
Netral Apps is built around a core belief:
> _"Writing is faster than clicking."_
By using a clean, structured syntax inspired by Markdown, Netral allows users to generate complex outputs with minimal UI friction.
- No ribbon bars.
- No hidden panels.
- Just structure.
